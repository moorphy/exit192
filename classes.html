  <h2>Our Educational Promise to you:</h2><br>
  <ul>
  <li>All courses are capped at 10 students to provide a more personalized and satisfying experience.</li><br>
  <li>All courses are capped at a 4 week length in order to be more accessible to people who have tricky schedules.  If you want  or need to spend more time on certain skills, we guarantee that any course can be repeated multiple times and it will always be a unique and challenging experience.</li><br>
  <li>Every course will be customized by the instructor as it progresses in order to better serve everyone’s individual needs.</li><br>
  <li>If you have a specific goal that does not seem to be represented in any of the classes, please let us know.  We can mold our classes to meet any personal objective.</li> <br>
  <li> Don’t let money get in the way of laughter and growth.  If any class cost is too much, please just tell us and we will make it do-able.</li> <br>
  <li>Any dissatisfied student may discontinue at any point during a course and receive a prorated refund for the remaining classes. </li> </p>
    </ul>
    <h4>REGISTERED STUDENTS<br>Class Details/ Good Things To Know:</h4><br>
          <ul>
    <li>Classes are held at Everett Improv - Suite 105 in the Everett Public Market Building at 2804 Grand Ave. Everett, Wa.</li>
    <li>Please show up at least 15 minutes early to your first class to allow time for check-in and payment.</li>
    <li>Wear comfortable clothing and footwear that you can move in.</li>
    <li>Please bring water or a beverage so you don’t get too parched during all of the shenanigans.  Also feel free to bring a snack.</li>
    <li>Improv is unpredictable.  Sensitive subject matter and personal physical boundaries may become an issue so we will check in at the beginning of the course to address any physical boundaries and any potential subject triggers that we should avoid as a group.  If you do not feel comfortable sharing those boundaries with the group, please reach out to your instructor privately and they can announce those boundaries.</li>
    <li>If at any point in class you become uncomfortable with anything happening, just say “time-out” or “we need to stop” and we will stop to address any concerns.</li>
    <li>Be supportive.  Comedy and personal growth both require vulnerability and a safe space.  If anyone displays negative attitudes, judgments, insensitivity, or aggression, they will be asked to leave.</li>
    <li>We are literally here for you.  Keep your instructor updated as to whether your personal goals for the course are being met.  If they aren’t, we will do everything we can to fix it.</li>

        <h1>THERE ARE TWO MAIN ADULT COURSE POOLS:</h1><br>
        <br>
    <div id="coursepoolleft">
      <h2>LIFE</h2><br>
      <h3>The "LIFE" courses are for anyone who wants to:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Get out of the house</li>
        <li>Try something new</li>

        <li>Train your mind to work faster, more creatively, more critically, and more confidently</li>

        <li>Learn and utilize improv without all the silly voices, body contortion, and super  theatre-y stuff </li>
        <li>Have fun and keep mentally flexible and prepared</li>

      </ul><br>
      <h5>*LIFE courses are signified by an L-code afer the title</h5>

    </div>
    <div id="coursepoolright">
      <h2>STAGE</h2><br>
      <h3>The "STAGE" courses are for anyone who wants to:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Get out of the house</li>
        <li>Try something new or “get back into it”</li>
        <li>Learn/continue to explore improv in an artistic and performance capacity</li>
        <li>Not be any version of themselves for a couple hours</li>
        <li>Apply improvisation skills to other artistic/creative mediums like writing, acting, dance, or stand-up</li>
        <li>Train your mind to work faster, more creatively, more critically, and more confidently</li>
        <li>Have fun and keep mentally flexible and prepared</li>
      </ul><br>
      <h5>*STAGE courses are signified by an S-code afer the title</h5><br><br>
    </div>

    <div id="adultcourseinfo">
      <h5>WHICH COURSE SHOULD I TAKE FIRST?</h5>
      <p>You will not see the word “level” or any numerology.  As many courses as possible are compartmentalised and have little to no prerequisites, allowing you to choose solely based on the skills you want to learn/practice.  There are also no course descriptions.  Why?  Boiled down, all improv courses use fun games, challenging exercises, and layered activities. Trust us, you’ll do lots of fun weird sh*t no matter which class you choose.  So you just get to focus on what you want to learn.  But if you want help picking, we are totally here and creepily staring at our inbox. </p><br>
      <h5>CANT I JUMP BETWEEN POOLS?</h5>
      <p>Heck, yes.  As long as there are no prerequisite skills, you can take any course from either pool in any order. </p><br>
      <h5>Registration Note: </h5><br>
      <p>Due to small class sizes, registration is required for all courses and classes.  But as long as there is space in the class, there is no registration deadline.</p>
